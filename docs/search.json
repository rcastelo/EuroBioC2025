We expect around 200 participants from the European and global bioinformatics community, coming from academia and industry. We are welcoming bioinformaticians, method developers, practitioners incorporating R/Bioconductor into robust workflows, and researchers using these tools for biological and biomedical discovery.\nYour sponsorship will help us provide a high-quality in-person event, and increase equity, diversity and inclusion at EuroBioC2025 by reducing registration costs and funding scholarships for students and other academic participants from lower income countries or with no other means of funding.\nFour levels of sponsorship are available. Sponsors of all levels are invited to submit an abstract within the deadline, which will be subject to review alongside submissions by attendees.

She is interested in integrating the information provided by phylogenetic trees, community interaction graphs and metabolic networks with sequencing data and clinical covariates. She uses computational statistics, in particular, nonparametric computer intensive methods such as the bootstrap and MCMC to draw inferences about many complex biological phenomena, interactions between the immune system and cancer, resilience and biomarker detection in the human microbiome and drug resistance in HIV. Her research group has developed open-source software implementing these methods, such as phyloseq and DADA2, which are freely available at the Bioconductor project for more than 10 years, and have become very popular among scientists analysing microbiome data.

Their approach is to integrate information into a computer model, and to this end Sharpes’s research group develops new imaging and computational methods to understand one example of organogenesis – vertebrate limb development.\n\nhttps://www.embl.org/groups/sharpe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTenure Track Assistant Professor, EPFL, Switzerland\n\nMaria Brbic (https://brbiclab.epfl.ch) is is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Life Sciences at EPFL. She is also affiliated with the EPFL AI Center and EPFL Institute of Bioengineering (IBI). Prior to joining EPFL, Maria was a postdoctoral researcher in Computer Science at Stanford University working with Jure Leskovec and was a member of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub at Stanford. She received her PhD degree from University of Zagreb in 2019, while also researching at Stanford University and University of Tokyo. Her research was awarded with the Fulbright Scholarship, L’Oreal UNESCO for Women in Science Scholarship, Branimir Jernej award for outstanding publication in biology and biomedicine, and Josip Loncar Silver Plaque award for the best doctoral dissertation. She has been named a Rising Star in EECS by MIT in 2021 and received Early Career Award by SIB in 2023.

He received his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge, where he investigated tissue-specific chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation in Caenorhabditis elegans. His postdoctoral research at the Institut Pasteur further explores the interplay between sequence composition and chromatin architecture in controlling gene regulation.  Jacques’ research aims to elucidate how these molecular mechanisms influence gene expression during development and in synthetic biological systems. In addition to his scientific contributions, Jacques is actively involved in the development of advanced software tools to support the integration and analysis of large-scale genomic data. He is the author of the online book “Orchestrating Hi-C analysis with Bioconductor” and has developed several Python and Bioconductor packages for Hi-C and epigenomic data analysis.

Late in her Ph.D., she received a Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) fellowship to visit Holger Heyn in Barcelona, Spain, where she is now a SNSF funded postdoc, collaborating with clinicians and biotech companies to analyze spatial transcriptomics data in an immuno-oncology context, e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia and colorectal cancer.

Late in her Ph.D., she received a Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) fellowship to visit Holger Heyn in Barcelona, Spain, where she is now a SNSF funded postdoc, collaborating with clinicians and biotech companies to analyze spatial transcriptomics data in an immuno-oncology context, e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia and colorectal cancer. Aside from her research, Helena received an inaugural Bioconductor Community Award, is a Bioconductor package reviewer, and current member of the project’s technical advisory board.\n\nhttps://helenalc.github.io"
